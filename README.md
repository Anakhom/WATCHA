# WATCHA

Welcome to [WATCHA](https://watcha01.herokuapp.com), your personal tracker of movies and series you have watched or want to watch. 
At WATCHA we call movies and series ðŸŽž watchas ðŸŽž, naturally. 
This app is for everyone who can't decide what to watch for way to long. Track all titles you love and never forget the name of that one movie you always wanted to see.
