# WATCHA

Welcome to [WATCHA](https://watcha01.herokuapp.com), your personal tracker of movies and series you have watched or want to watch. 
At WATCHA we call movies and series ðŸŽž watchas ðŸŽž, naturally. 
This app is for everyone who can't decide what to watch for way to long. Track all titles you love and never forget the name of that one movie you always wanted to see.

### Future of WATCHA
WATCHA is just at the beginning of the journey. Initially written on handelbars, WATCHA's obvious future is React.js. But from there, we have some plans too:
<br/>

- [X] Add option to follow friends and other users
- [X] Live feed displaying your friends' watchas 
- [X] Add chat options with WebSockets
- [X] More options for search engine, such as filters and recommendations 

#### Thank you for exploring WATCHA!
